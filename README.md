# Terraform-GCP-Remote-Backend

**Description:**
This repository contains Terraform configuration files for setting up a remote backend on Google Cloud Platform (GCP). By utilizing Google Cloud Storage (GCS) as the backend, you can centralize your Terraform state files, enabling collaboration and version control for infrastructure as code projects.

**Features:**
- Configures GCS as a remote backend for Terraform.
- Enables secure storage and versioning of Terraform state files.
- Facilitates collaboration and concurrent infrastructure deployments.

**Prerequisites:**
1. Google Cloud Platform (GCP) account with appropriate permissions.
2. Terraform installed on your local machine.
3. Basic knowledge of GCP and Terraform concepts.

**Folder Structure:**
- **.terraform**: Directory containing Terraform configuration files and plugins.
- **main.tf**: Main configuration file defining the backend and other resources.
- **variables.tf**: File containing input variables for the Terraform configuration.

**Setup Instructions:**
1. Clone this repository to your local machine using `git clone`.
2. Navigate to the `terraform` directory.
3. Open `variables.tf` and modify the input variables as per your requirements.
4. Configure your GCP credentials and authentication using `gcloud auth` or by setting the `GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS` environment variable.
5. Initialize Terraform with `terraform init` to download plugins and initialize the backend.
6. Run `terraform apply` to create the GCS bucket and configure it as the remote backend.
